# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks introducing the basic concepts of Natural Language Processing.

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. Digital assistants like Google’s Voice Assistant and Apple’s Siri are built on complex NLP models. NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations and increase employee productivity. With increasing applications in multidisciplinary fields and an increased interest in human-to machine communications combined with the vast data being generated on a regular basis, this field is rapidly advancing.

## Course Overview

This course aims to provide a solid foundation in NLP fundamentals. We'll start by exploring basic text processing techniques, followed by an introduction to sentiment analysis, text classification, and essential concepts like Part-of-Speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition. By the end of this course, you'll have a clear understanding of the key principles in NLP and be equipped to apply them in various contexts.
